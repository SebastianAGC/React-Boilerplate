# Usage
To use the boilerplate, simply navigate to the path *src/components/App/*. In there you'll find two files. *App.js* file is where you are going to the develop your own react application. *App.css* file is where you can customize your css classes to fit your app needs. After modifying your files, run the command:

```
npm run build
```
This will build your app and generate an index.html, main.js and all of your other components into the "dist" folder. Now that your app is all made up, start it using the following command:

```
npm start
```

Now your app will be running. At [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

This boilerplate comes with a Jest test-runner built-in to start testing your scripts. You can try out the built-in test that comes with the boilerplate in *sum.test.js*. To run the Jest test file execute:

```
npm run test
```
To create a test for *YourFile.js* simply create a *YourFile.test.js* file to start coding all the tests you need to run.
